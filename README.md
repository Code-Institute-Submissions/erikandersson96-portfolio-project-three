# Formula One Quiz 

Formula One Quiz is a quiz built with Python. The quiz has 12 questions and for every question there is 2 options for the answer but only 1 is correct. 
The questions are all subjected around Formula One, both about historical moments from the very start until the 2020 season. So if you want to test your knowledge

## Portfolio Project Three 

### Intention 

This website is a fictional website for the purpose of my Third Portfolio Project for Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Development Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the `Python` module.

The main goal of this project was to test my new knowledge in Python. I decided to create a 12 question Quiz Game about Formula One. 

##### Features I aimed to achieve with this project:

* To make the game `easy` to understand for the user. 
* Make sure that the game has good `instructions` through out the whole game so the user doesn't get confuesed. 
* To get people more educated about the sport of Formula One.

### Manual Testing 

#### Bugs & solutions

* **Bug 1:** 
Write wrong character option when user answer a question. 
When playing the quiz, if the user inputs a wrong character instead of '1 or 2' which are the only accepted answers the 
user will get a warning that says `"Only enter eiter '1 or 2'. You entered something else. "` to let the user know that 
he or she didn't input a valid value. But if the user then tries to choose either '1 or 2' the program will repeat the same 
issue and won't let the user input the valid value to countinue the quiz.

**Bug 1 Solution:**

**Bug 2:** 
When exit the game Rules. 
When the user is finsihed reading the game Rules for the quiz, he or she is supposed to Type 'm or M' and then press enter to 
get back to the Meny. But when the user does this the program doesn't respond correctly before the user tries for the second time. 
When the user types 'm or M' and press enter, first nothing happens so when the user then repeat's the process a second time the program 
responds and get the user back to the Meny but it gives the user a error message above the Meny that the user didn't use the correct 
command. So the program gets quite confusing for the user when this bug happens.
