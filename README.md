## Portfolio Project Three 

### Intention 

This website is a fictional website for the purpose of my Third Portfolio Project for Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Development Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the `Python` module.

The main goal of this project was to test my new knowledge in Python. I decided to create a 12 question Quiz Game about Formula One. 

##### Features I aimed to achieve with this project:

* To make the game `easy` to understand for the user. 
* Make sure that the game has good `instructions` through out the whole game so the user doesn't get confuesed. 
* To get people more educated about the sport of Formula One.
