# Formula One Quiz 

Formula One Quiz is a quiz built with Python. The quiz has 12 questions and for every question there is 2 options for the answer but only 1 is correct. 
The questions are all subjected around Formula One, both about historical moments from the very start until the 2020 season. So if you want to test your knowledge 
in Formula One, play the quiz. 

**Remember that all links in this Readme does not open in a new tab. They open in the same window.**

## Portfolio Project Three 

### Intention 

This website is a fictional website for the purpose of my Third Portfolio Project for Code Institute’s Full Stack Software Development Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the `Python` module.

The main goal of this project was to test my new knowledge in Python. I decided to create a 12 question Quiz Game about Formula One. 

##### Features I aimed to achieve with this project:

* To make the game `easy` to understand for the user. 
* Make sure that the game has good `instructions` through out the whole game so the user doesn't get confuesed. 
* To get people more educated about the sport of Formula One. 


---
## How To Play 

This quiz consists of 6 or 12 questions, and the answer for each question will be either one of two options that are displayed underneath. 

You will have to Type either '1' or '2' to select the answer you think is the correct one and press Enter.

The quiz will countinue until all questions has been played for the selected amount of questions. 

When you are finished with all of the selected questions you get asked to play again, if you press "N" (no) to exit. Just reload the page and the game will restart. 

Good luck! And have fun.

## UX 

#### Strategy 

This Formula One Quiz was created with the intention to test peoples knowledge in the sport. A game that people can share among their friends and family to challenge each other's knowledge. 
Since the whole game is operated entirely in the terminal with no colorful graphics the user can then try to imagine how the different drivers, team's and situations would look like 
for that given time. 

#### Visitor Goals 

* To create a simple and fun Quiz for everyone above 14+ years old. 
* To give the user a simple navigation at the main menu with simple instructions. 
* To always provide the user with all the information about which question that is displayed of the amount that the user choose (6 or 12) 
and count how many points the user has scored for each question. 

#### User Stories 

* **A user's perspective:** I want to easily understand the purpose of the website.  
* **A user's perspective:** I want the quiz to have clear instructions about how the game works. 
* **A user's perspective:** I want the game to always provide me with information about how many questions I have played and have left, also how many points I have scored.

## Website Design

I modified my `CSS` in the `layout.html` file to add a header `"logo"` above to center align everything including the terminal, I added a `h2` message below and both 
`Instagram and Facebook`. I also added a background color of red. 

This is how it looks on `Heroku`: 

![Screenshot of terminal on heroku app](/assets/images/heroku.png) 

The red color I choose for the background serves a puspose since it is the same red color code that `Ferrari F1 Team` use for their 2022 formula one car. 

Here is a image of `Ferrari F1 Team 2022 formula one car` color code: 

![Screenshot of Ferrari F1 Team 2022 formula one car color code](/assets/images/ferrari.png)

## Logic 

### Flow Diagram 

Before I started to write any code for this project I made sure to create an easy and straightforward `Flow Diagram` with all the logic for this Quiz. The `Flow Diagram` was created with the use of 
[Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) (link). I used the free version that is available for anyone that register an acount at their website. My `Flow Diagram` is demonstrated below. 

![Screenshot of my flow diagram first part](/assets/images/flow1.png) 
![Screenshot of my flow diagram last part](/assets/images/flow2.png)

### Explain Logic in Flow Chart

First the user starts the program. Secondly the user gets to the `Menu` with 3 options `Start Quiz | Leaderboard | Game Rules`. 

If the user choose `Leaderboard` the user will be displayed with the leaderboard stats and when the user wants to get back to the `Menu` the user just type `m or M`. If the user types an invalid input (not m or M) a message will appear with instructions about this. 

If the user choose `Game Rules` the user will be displayed the game rules and when the user wants to get back to the `Menu` the same principle works as for `Leaderboard` type `m or M` with the same message for invalid inputs. 

If the user choose `Start Quiz` the user will be asked for a `username`, the user can input anything (alphabetic only) maximum of 10 characters. If the user types the wrong character a message with instructions will appear to guide the user right in order to continue the Quiz. 

When the user has inputted a valid `username` the user will be asked for how many question that he or she would like to play `6 or 12`, the user can only input 6 or 12 as a valid input otherwise a message with instructions will appear that guides the user on how to continue. 

After this question the Quiz will start, when the user gets displayed with a question the user gets 2 options for the only one correct answer, this will be listed as `1 or 2`. If the user types anything else then 1 or 2 a message will appear with instructions about how to continue the Quiz. If the user answers correct he or she will be rewarded with +1 point. If the user answers incorrect he or she will not get any point. The loop with questions will continue until all questions has been displayed of the selected amount `6 or 12`. 

When the user has finsihed all questions of the amount that the user selected a `End Message` will appear with the users `username and total score`. 

To continue the user has to `Please press enter to continue...` to get a final question if he or she would like to either `play again` or `exit` the program by answer `Yes or No` by typing `y or Y` for Yes and `n or N` for no. If the user types anything else here a message with instructions will appear to guide the user to the correct input. If the user types `Yes` he or she will be taken back to the `Menu` with options or the program will exit if the user types `No`. 


---
## Existing Features

### Start Screen 

When the program starts the user will get a `Welcome message` including a `"Banner"` and a menu of three different options `Start Quiz | Leaderboard | Game Rules`. Underneath the menu the user can find the instructions about how to select the different options from the menu. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of start screen](/assets/images/welcome.png)

If the user doesn't care to follow the instructions or accidentally types the wrong character instead a message will appear to inform the user that he or she has to try again with a valid input. See the screenshot below:  

![Screenshot of error message wrong input start screen](/assets/images/welcome-wrong.png)

### Leaderboard & Game Rules

When the user selects the `Leaderboard` option he or she will see a leaderboard containing the top 3 finishers of the two different question selections either 6 or 12. When the user want's to exit the leaderboard an get back to the menu there is instructions below that explains this. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of leaderboard](/assets/images/leaderboard.png)

When the user selects the `Game Rules` option he or she will first get a message that welcomes the user to the Game Rules, after that all of the Game Rules will be displayed. When the user want to exit the Game Rules and get back to the menu there is instructions below that explains this. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of Game Rules](/assets/images/rules.png)

When the user want to exit the `Leaderboard or Game Rules` to get back to the menu and accidentally types the wrong character instead of `m or M` a message will appear to inform the user that he or she has to try again with a valid input. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of exit leaderboard or game rules](/assets/images/rules-wrong.png)

### Username 

When the user selects `Start Quiz` to start the quiz a message will appear that says that the user needs to fill in a username, some instructions underneath the first message will inform the user that the username can't be any longer then 10 characters, it can't inculde numbers or special characters. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of type in username](/assets/images/username.png)

If the user selected a `valid username` this message will appear: 

![Screenshot of type in username](/assets/images/username-correct.png)

When the user types in his or her username and accidentally types anything else then alphabetics a message will appear to inform the user that he or she has to try again with a valid input. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of error when type in username](/assets/images/username-wrong.png)

### Question Selection 

After the user has selected a valid `username` he or she will be asked how many questions to play either `6 or 12`. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of question selection](/assets/images/amount-questions.png)

If the user types an invalid number or character not `6 or 12` a message will appear with instructions of how to continue. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of error message question selection](/assets/images/amount-wrong.png)

### Questions 

The `questions` in the Quiz will be displayed to the user right after that the user has selected a valid input between `6 or 12` for the question selection, the user can choose between two options for each question, but only one is the correct answer. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of question](/assets/images/question.png)

If the user inputs the correct answer of `either 1 or 2` this message will appear. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of correct answer for question](/assets/images/answer-correct.png) 

If the user inputs the wrong answer of `either 1 or 2` this message will appear. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of wrong answer for question](/assets/images/answer-wrong.png)

When the user `answers` the question he or she can only input either `1 or 2` as a valid answer for the question, if the user inputs anything else then one of these a message will appear with instructions of how to continue. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of error message question](/assets/images/question-wrong.png)

### End Message

When the user has `completed` all questions of the selected amount `6 or 12 questions` a result message will appear to inform the user about how many points he or she got. The user will see underneath `Please press enter to continue...`. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of end message](/assets/images/end-message.png)

### Play Again 

When the user has pressed enter a message will appear with a question to the user that ask the user if he or she wants to play again or quit the quiz. If the user choose to play again 
`Y (yes)` he or she will be directed back to the menu, if the user choose `N (no)` the quiz will exit. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of play again, yes or no](/assets/images/play-again.png)

If the user input something else then `Y or N` a message will appear to inform the user that he or she needs to try again with a valid option. See the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of error message play again, yes or no](/assets/images/play-again-error.png)

## Future Features 

A feature that I would like to add that I didn't have the time for to add to this project is the abilty to record the time that the user takes to answer each question. 
So the `Formula One Quiz` would have been a little more challenging amongst friends when they are playing against eachother and the also implement the time to the leaderboard. 
If I were to use this function I would need to use this combination `start_time = time.time() and end_time = time.time()`.  

Add some extra time delays for the correct or wrong answers for the user. But since `Heroku` updated their process for deployment I felt unsure about how to update my code push it and then create a new app with new config vars. I tried to do this but then my app wasn't created in some wierd way even when I followed the steps for manual deploy thru `Gitpod` terminal. 
The app might have some bad user experience now because the time delay is a bit short, but I am fully aware of it and I would have changed it if I knew how to solve this manual heroku deployment problem. When my experience gets better I will be better for improving this in the future for future projects.

## Testing

### Manual Testing 
  
##### Input 

I have tested my program all the time with the wrong type of inputs like: 

* **Menu:** 
At the menu I have tried to input anything else then `s or S to start the quiz, l or L for leaderboard, r or R for game rules` and the program runs a message that says that I have typed  wrong input and have to try again with a correct one. 

* **Start Quiz:**
  * **Username:** When the game asks for a username it is expecting only alphabetics and maximun length of 10 characters (so no numbers or special characters!). If I try to type let say: 5 I get a message that says `Not longer then 10 characters. Written with numbers or special characters. Try again!`. Even if I try to write longer then 10 characters I get the same message.
  * **How many questions?:** When the game asks for how many questions I would like 6 or 12, if I then type in `5` or `a` I will get a message that says 
  `You didn't Type in '6 or 12'! Please choose only one.`. 
  * **Question:** When a question is displayed the game is expecting only 1 or 2 as valid inputs but if I try to input `3` or `Hello` I will get a message that says 
  `Only enter either '1 or 2'. You entered something else...`. 
  * **Play again, Yes or No:** At the final step of the game were it asks me if I want to play again or exit the game, if I then type in `Banana` or `1` I will get a message that says
  `You did not Type 'y or Y' for yes to play the quiz again or 'n or N' for no to exit the program. You typed something else, try again.`. 

* **Leaderboard:** When I choose the Leaderboard at the menu and then wish to get back to the Menu, I need to type m or M. But if I try to type something else like `hello` or `2` I will get a pop up message for 3 seconds that says `Did you really press 'm or M'? Try again!`. 

* **Game Rules:** When I choose the Game Rules at the Menu and then wish to get back to the Menu, I need to type m or M. But if I try something else I will get the same pop up message as in leaderboard. 

All checking for validation when expecting a user input works correctly as expected. 

##### Game Play

Throughout the whole development of this Quiz I have tested the game in the GitPod terminal to see that my functions are working as expected, but also to debugg my code if my program have not operated as I expected it to do. 

### Bugs 
 
* **Bug 1:**
End message doesn't show up. 
When the user has answered all of the selected questions (6 or 12). The end message should show up with: 
`Well done! I hope your Formula One knowledge got a little better with this quiz.`, `{user_name} you scored at total of {point} points!`.
`{user_name}` and `{points}` is used in an f-string to input the user name of the user and the total points that the user scored. 
But the end message does not show up at all, the Quiz just goes back to the the meny. Like shown in the screenshot below:

**Screenshot:**

![Screenshot bug 1](/assets/images/welcome-wrong.png)

* **Solution Bug 1:**
It was as simple as that I had forgot to add end_message with the correct parameters in the `main()` function.  

* **Bug 2:** 
My leaderboard not showing the correct values. 
When I tried to run my leaderboard I only got the id of worksheet 6 and 12, not the actual users and points. Like shown in the screenshot below: 

**Screenshot:** 

![Screenshot bug 2](/assets/images/bug2.png)

* **Solution Bug 2:**
First I tried to write a whole loop that was going to sort the leaderboard for me so I could get the correct order for the user who was number one and the third for the user who was number three in the ranking. But after speaking to my mentor, [Benjamin](https://github.com/BAK2K3) (link) suggested me to search for `GSPREAD documentation` and the sort method. And I found in that documentation the `sort()` method. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel I just had to use the sort() method. Here is a link to the [sort()](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=sort#gspread.worksheet.Worksheet.sort) method for GSPREAD.  


### Validation

When testing my code in [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) validation tool I got no errors except that I had no newline at the bottom of the file. But that was only me erasing the last line in `PEP8` before checking my code because I thought that was correct. But since `GitPod` wont let me save my file without erros unless I have a newline at the bottom. Now I have changed that but I want to show a screenshot of the first `PEP8` result and underneath I will show the fixed screenshot. See images below: 

**No Newline:**
![Screenshot PEP8 validation error](/assets/images/pep8.png)

**With Newline:**
![Screenshot PEP8 validation no error](/assets/images/pep8-2.png)
 

### User Story Testing 

To meet the expectations in the user stories. I have tested my python project for each of them.

1. **Goal** 
* A user's perspective: I want to easily understand the purpose of the website. 

**Result**
* By presenting the game with `"F1 QUIZ"` first and a welcome message that explains that says `"Welcome to this Formula One Quiz!"`, so the user quickly understand the purpose of this website (python project). 

2. **Goal**
* A user's perspective: I want the quiz to have clear instructions about how the game works.

**Result**
* By always presenting instructions below each step the user takes in the game. 

3. **Goal**
* A user's perspective: I want the game to always provide me with information about how many questions I have played and have left, also how many points I have scored.

**Result**
* By adding the functionality to see which question of the selected amount the user is on right above each question. When the user has answered a question and if the user is correct the total points scored will be displayed underneath, but also when the game is finished. 


### Device Testing 

Since this project is dependent to run in a mock terminal it is restricted to `desktop` use only, otherwise it will be a bad user experience on a smaller screen device.

## Python Libraries 

**Python libraries used for this project:** 
* **Os:** I choose to import this one so that I could enable the possibility for me to create a function that works as `"clear()"`, so I could call it within other functions so the terminal clears other text that were displayed before. The same principle is used when using the terminal in other situations and you want to clear out all unnecessary text so you get a cleaner look. Here you can take a look at the website of [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) (link).
* **Time:** I choose to import time to be able to set time delays `(time.sleep(seconds))` within certain functions so the Quiz doesn't executes to fast for the user to be able read the information. Here you can take a look at the website of [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) (link).
* **Random:** I had to import random in order for me to generate a random order of the questions for the user. 
This Formula One Quiz was created with the intention to test peoples knowledge in the sport. A game that people can share among their friends and family to challenge each other's knowledge. Here you can take a look at the website of [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (link).
* **Pyfiglet:** I choose to import [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/) (link) so I could display `"F1 QUIZ"` in a 3d look without the need to create it myself. Take a look at their website to get all of the instructions to how you can implement it your self to your next python project.

## Content

#### Media 

The `Ferrari red` color for the background was taken from [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color/a6051a) (link), you can take a look at the color at their website by cliking the link. 

#### Footer 

The `footer` with the icons for the different social media links was taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (link).

## Credits

#### Code 

My mentor [Benjamin Kavanagh](https://github.com/BAK2K3) suggested me to use [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/) (link) instead of trying to create my own figlet in the 
`Start Screen` that says `F1 QUIZ`. 

![Screenshot of pyfiglet](/assets/images/pyfiglet.png)

I used the `sort()` method after suggested to do so by my mentor [Benjamin Kavanagh](https://github.com/BAK2K3) for sorting my leaderboard rankings, I found this method in the documentation for `GSPREAD`. It can be found [here](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/api.html?highlight=sort#gspread.worksheet.Worksheet.sort) (link). 

![Screenshot of sort() method GSPREAD docs](/assets/images/sort.png)

---
## Deployment 

**GitHub:**

I frequently used `commit` throughout the whole project, this is the commands used in the terminal: 

* `git add .` (This command is used for adding files to the staging area before committing).
* `git commit -m “commit message here..”` (This is used to label the commit changes made to the local repository).
* `git push` (This command is used to push all changes to the Github repository). 

This is all done to prevent any `data` loss in case Gitpod crashes and saves the `data` to GitHub. 


### GitHub & Gitpod 

For this project I used Code Institutes Python template that can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) (link). 

**Steps to create a new repository in Github:**

1. Sign in or sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com) (link). 
1. When you have done that, you will see `"new"` up in the left corner. 
**Like this:**
![Screenshot new repository button github](/assets/images/github.png)
1. Select in the dropdown menu under `Repository template` if you for example would like to use the template provided by `Code Institute` that I did for this project. If you don't see it in the dropdown menu click this [link](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to get to the one provided by `Code Institute` and click `Use this template` to the left of the green Gitpod button.
1. When you have done that, give the repository a name. Leave it public if you want anyone on the internet to see your repository (I always do). 
1. Click create repository. 
1. **Remember** to use the `commit` commands that I explained above so your hard work doesn't get lost if anything happens to Gitpod. 

### Forking GitHub Repository

Forking a Github repository is the process of making a copy of someone else repository and add your own changes to it without changing the original, the original repository is known 
as "upstream repository". I will explain the process of forking down below: 

1. Go to the Github page that hosts the repository you wish to fork. 
1. In the top-right corner of the page there is a button that says `"Fork"`. 
1. Click this button. 
1. This creates a copy of that repository to your Github home page. You can submit and receive changes to your copy by using pull requests and/or syncing with the original upstream repository. 

This instructions were taken from [Github - Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 

### Cloning GitHub Repository

Cloning a repository inolves making a full copy of a repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on the code easier. Changes can be pushed back up to the Github site or changes from other sources pulled to your local copy. I will explain how to clone down below: 

1. Go to the repository page on Github. 
1. Above the file list click on the green button that says `"Code"`. 
1. You can choose to download a zip file of the repository, to unpack it on your local machine and open it in your IDE. 
1. Clone using HTTPS by copying the URL under the HTTPS tab. 
1. Open a terminal window, set current directory to the one you want to contain the clone from. 
1. Type `git clone` and paste the URL copied from the Github page. 
1. The repository clone will now be created on your machine. 

This instructions were taken from [Github - cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Heroku 

Deploying a project using Heroku: 

* Visit the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (link) website and click on create an account. 
* Click the `"New"` button. 
* Click the `"Create new app"` button. 
* Provide a name for the app in the `App` name input field. 
* Select your region from the `"choose region"` dropdown menu. 
* Click the `"Create App"` button. 
* Once redirected, proceed to the settings tab. 
* Click on the `"config vars"` button. 
* Supply a `KEY` of `PORT` and it's value of `8000`. Then click the `"add"` button. 
* Next step is to add `Buildpacks`, click the `"Add Buildpack"` button. 
* The `python` buildpack needs to be added first then the `node js` buildpack. 
* Once the buildpacks have completed, got to the deploy screen, once in the deploy screen, select GitHub as the deployment method and connect your GitHub profile. 
* Search for the repository that you wish to deploy to `Heroku` and click `"connect"`. 
* Once your repository is connected to Heroku you can choose to either automatically or manually deploy your app. 
* I choose manual deploy beacuse I like to refresh the branch myself when I update my project. 
* By selecting automatic deploy, Heroku will build a new version of the app each time a change has been made and pushed to the repository on `GitHub`. 
* By selecting manual deploys, it allows you to build a new version of your app whenever you click manual deploy. 
* If your build is successful you will then be able to visit the live site by clicking the link that is provided to you by `Heroku`. 

New way of deploy project to heroku: 
* When you want to deploy your project to `Heroku`. 
* Type `heroku login -i` to login to your existing account (if you have one) in the `Gitpod` terminal. 
* Then run the command `heroku create your_app_name_here` to create a new app (the name has to be uniqe). 
* Now you can see your new project at `Heroku` dashboard and set the config vars and buildpacks as the steps explained above. 

The command to add packages to the requirments.txt file, `pip3 freeze --local > requirments.txt`.
